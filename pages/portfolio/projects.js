            Throughout my journey in Republic Polytecnic pursuing the Diploma of
            information technology, I&lsquo;ve been exploring different
            applications of IT and where my interest would be in. By the end of
            year 2, I found that there was something in programming that
            intrigued me. Since then, I&lsquo;ve started to do some
            self-learning and have taken part in 3 projects, one being my
            final-year-project, second during my internship and lastly, this
            website

                The web platform will provide youths an easy-access platform to
                browse opportunities, supercharging their self-sourced
                internship experience. It also seeks to introduce new
                opportunities to youths, which would otherwise not have been
                discovered / possible

                Without any prior knowledge on Javascript, HTML or css, I had
                quickly skim through documentations and set up the base
                application to work on within the first week. Subsquently, I was
                tasked to create the Navigation Bar, main Opportunities listing
                page, Opportunity details page, Favourites page, making review
                page and a page for users to monitor the state of applications.
                I was also in charge of maintaining and securing routes,
                ensuring that certain routes are only accessible by
                authenticated users
